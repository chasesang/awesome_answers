<h1>New Question</h1>


<%# render helps you insert (or render) a partial so Rails expect in here that
    you've defined a partial within the same folder of this file (new.html.erb)
    called `_form.html.erb` so the file path should be:
    `/app/view/questions/_form.html.erb`. Note that partials will have access to
    instance variables so there is no need pass them explicitly.
    If you want to pass a local variable then you will need to do so explicilty
    as in:  render 'form', my_var: 'abc'
    Also, if the partial is in another folder (such as contact) then you will
    have to put the full path for the partial as in: render '/contact/form'
     %>

<%= render 'form' %>

<%# form_for is a built-in Rails helper that enables us to generate a form form
    an ActiveRecrod model to submit to the associated controller. If you pass in
    a non-persisted ActiveRecord object (not in the DB yet) then `form_for` will
    automatically assume that this form will submit to the `create` action in
    the associated controller (in our case questions#create) which has a path
    helper of `questions_path` so we must have `questions_path` defined %>
